##### Further Information

The Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) is the national railway company of Switzerland. SBB moves people, goods and manages large amounts of infrastructure – be it with focus on railroads or real estate.

Our goals are offering rail excellence and at the same time shaping the mobility of the future. This includes combined mobility, where customers travel a fraction of their journey with a different mode of transportation. In our case: Driving to the train station with a car and then switching to a train ride. 

#### The challenge: Improve the occupancy forecast of «Park+Rail»

Precisely at this moment in our customer journey – the arrival of the combined mobility user at the «Park+Rail» parking lot – we would like to boost convenience and satisfaction with your valuable thoughts and ideas. Can you help us improve the occupancy forecast for our «Park+Rail» customers? 

#### Forecasting so far: majority of variables are known, but not the interaction

Today, we don’t know exactly which and by what amount different parameters influence the occupancy of our Park+Rail facilities. Different variables such as the size of the parking spaces, size of the train stations, the day of the week, weather conditions, public holidays, major outages and big events have been discussed. 

However, to the present day, we are still lacking a useful model for reliable occupancy parking spot prediction. Do you have a striking idea?
